The improvement of well known Crossing Number (cn) algorithm determining the inclusion of a point P in a 2D planar polygon. 

This implementation is tested against standard Crossing Number (cn) algorithm, Winding Number (wn) algorithm and the PostGIS implementation. <img src="http://forum.srpskinacionalisti.com/images/smilies/eusa_snooty.gif" alt="there's a better" height="15" width="16">

Unlike standard methods (cn and wn), this one WORKS ON EDGES with no performance cost. (on the contrary)

(The C++ implementation of the same algorithm is given <a href="https://github.com/sasamil/PointInPolygon">here</a>.)
